- If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in its corresponding position in the word.

- If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn on the screen.

5. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

- You win if you guess the word before the hangman is complete;
