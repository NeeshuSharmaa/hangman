# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game project! This is a **React TypeScript** implementation of the classic word-guessing game. Test your vocabulary and have fun with this interactive and educational game. (●'◡'●)

## How to Play

The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where you need to guess the hidden word by selecting letters one by one. Here's how to play:

1. You will see a series of dashes representing the letters in the hidden word.

2. Click on the letters on the screen to guess if they are part of the word.

3. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in its corresponding position in the word.

4. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn on the screen.

5. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

6. You win if you guess the word before the hangman is complete; otherwise, you lose.

Enjoy and have fun!
